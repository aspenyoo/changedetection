This file contains all code used for Aspen's change detection project. 

## Directories
All directories have READMEs, so details of each can be found within. The rough organization of files are as follows:
- analysis/: scripts and functions that have to do with fitting and analyzing data
- data/: contains reorganized data as well as data reorganization scripts
- experiment_data/: contains experimental code (and raw data)
- multi_item_scratch.m: very messy script containing a slew of analyses and plots that I did while working on the project
